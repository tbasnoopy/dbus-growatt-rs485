Integrate Growatt over Modbus/RS485 into Victron Energies Venus OS

## Purpose
With the scripts in this repo it should be easy possible to install, uninstall, restart a service that connects the Growatt Inverter over Modbus/RS485 to the VenusOS and GX devices from Victron.

## Inspiration
This is my first project with the Victron Venus OS on GitHub, so I took some ideas and approaches from the following projects - many thanks for sharing the knowledge:
